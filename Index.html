            <h2>An Introduction to Web development</h2>
            <p>Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that you access through a
                browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).</p>

            <h2>Why semantics matter </h2>
            <p>semantics matter in HTML because they give meaning to the content of a webpage, both for machines (like
                browsers and screen readers) and humans (like developers and users).</p>

            <h2>Importance of HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML is the foundation of every website you visit. Without it, there would be no web pages. Hereâ€™s a
                simple breakdown of why HTML is so important:

                1. ðŸ§± Itâ€™s the Building Block of the Web
                HTML is what gives structure to a web page.
                It tells the browser:

                What is a heading

                What is a paragraph

                Where to find images

                How to create links, lists, tables, and more.

                Without HTML, a web page would just be a blank screen.</p>
